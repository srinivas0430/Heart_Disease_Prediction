# Heart_Disease_Prediction
Context:
In this project we will predict the risk of heart attack a person has we will do various ML algorithm to the result.

Following steps to be done:
•	Data Analysis 
•	Feature Engineering 
•	Standardisation 
•	Model Building 
•	Prediction

Content:
The dataset has 13 features to predict the target whether the observed patient is diagnosed with heart disease or not. Some of the features are quite obscure, especially for those without prior medical knowledge. In order to understand each variable to ease the data analysis, I have searched simple explanation from multiple sources.

Explanation of all the parameters is mentioned in the document.
